# Payment-Gateway-Integration

Project developed during Internship at The Sparks Foundation (#task3)

Simple website where payment gateway is integrated from Razorpay. There is a simple donate button that loads the payment page where the user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type. Once payment is done an invoice will be generated and an email will be sent to the donor.
