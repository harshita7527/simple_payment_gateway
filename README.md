# Payment-Gateway-Integration

Project developed during Internship at The Sparks Foundation (#task3)

Simple website where payment gateway is integrated from Rajorpay. There is a simple donate button which loads the payment page where the user can select amount to be paid and the payment type. Once payment is done an invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the donar.
